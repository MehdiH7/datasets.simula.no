The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a flood of misinformation on social media, which has been labeled an "infodemic".
While a large part of such fake news is ultimately inconsequential, some of it has the potential to real-world harm, but due to the massive amount of social media contents, it is impossible to find this misinformation manually. 
Thus, conventional fact-checking can typically only counteract misinformation narratives after they have gained significant traction. 
Only automated systems can provide warnings in advance. 
However, the automatic detection of misinformation narratives is very challenging since the texts that spread misinformation may be short messages on Twitter. 
They may also transmit misinformation by implication rather than by stating counterfactual information outright, and satirical messages complicate the issue further. 
Thus, there is a need for highly sophisticated detection systems. 
In order to support their development, we created substantial ground truth data by human annotation.
Here, we present a dataset that deals with a specific piece of misinformation: the idea that the COVID-19 pandemic is causally connected to the 5G wireless network. 
We selected more than 10,000 tweets that deal with COVID-19 and 5G and labeled them manually, distinguishing between tweets that propagate the specific 5G misinformation, those that spread other conspiracy theories, and tweets that do neither.
