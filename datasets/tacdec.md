# TACDEC Dataset

TACDEC is a dataset of tackle events in soccer game videos. Recognizing the gap in existing open datasets that predominantly focus on official soccer events such as goals and cards, TACDEC targets a comprehensive analysis of tackles — a critical aspect of soccer that combines technical skills, tactical decision-making, and physical engagement. By leveraging video data from the Norwegian Eliteserien league across multiple seasons, we annotated 425 videos with 4 types of tackle events, categorized into "tackle-live", "tackle-replay", "tackle-live-incomplete", and "tackle-replay-incomplete", yielding a total of 836 event annotations. The dataset offers an unprecedented resource for the development and testing of machine learning models aimed at understanding and analyzing soccer game dynamics.
