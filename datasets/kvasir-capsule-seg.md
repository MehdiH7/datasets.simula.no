Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) or capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive technology designed to provide diagnostic imaging of the small intestine. The patient swallows a capsule that moves through the digestive tract and captures thousands of images that physicians can further examine. Machine learning and deep learning-based algorithms are gaining popularity in improving the anomaly detection rate and decreasing manual labor for this specific application. To be able to create an efficient model, data is important. In this respect, we release KvasirCapsule-SEG, a publicly available dataset that can help design better segmentation algorithms in the field of VCE technology.

## Dataset Details
KvasirCapsule-SEG is an enchanced subset of Kvasir-Capsule which contains polyp images, their segmentation ground truth and bounding box information. The polyp class of Kvasir-Capsule has only 55 images which we annotated with the help of an expert gastroenterologist. As can be seen in the figure below, we have generated both ground truth and bounding box information with separate folders for images, ground truth, and images with bounding boxes. Examples of polyps and their corresponding masks from KvasirCapsule-SEG can be found here.

## Suggested Evaluation Metrics
For evaluation purposes, we suggest standard computer vision metrics such as dice coefficient (DSC), mean intersection over union (mIoU), Precision, Recall, Specificity, Accuracy, and FPS. A detailed description of these metrics can be found in our paper.
