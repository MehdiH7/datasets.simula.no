Here, we make available a real-world, server-side packet trace. Anarchy Online is a massively multiplayer on-line roleplaying game (MMORPG) by Funcom, and after more than ten years, Anarchy Online has become one of the oldest surviving games in the genre. We are aware of several existing related datasets for other games or virtual worlds, but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first available dataset from a large commercial game provider captured at the game server. We present statistics from the network traffic and show that it is a representative dataset for similar games. We hope that the dataset can be used to push research forward in the field of better system support for applications like games. More information about the dataset can be found in the dataset paper from MMSYS 2012.
